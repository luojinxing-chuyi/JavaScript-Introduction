Hello everyone, welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript!

1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,110
In this module, after giving a brief history of JavaScript and Web browsers,

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,930
we will explain how HTML, CSS and JavaScript are related to one another.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,850
We will see JavaScript in action through numerous interactive examples.

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,590
We have made sure that all examples can be run directly in the course’s Web pages.

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,360
Hey, we’re teaching Web technologies, after all!

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,859
We will do that throughout the course, as you will be asked to change some code,

7
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,769
tweak this or that example, even if the code details are not fully explained at first.

8
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:49,190
Because, this is how we recommend beginners to learn JavaScript: first look at examples,

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,659
then tweak some code and see the results of the changes.

10
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:59,640
You will certainly encounter error messages, but no worries, as I will teach you how to

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,460
debug JavaScript code using your browser’s devtool console.

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:11,140
In this first module, you will also learn about JavaScript variables, operators and

13
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,180
expressions, and have a first lesson about functions, objects, arrays and strings.

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,180
These are the basic concepts of JavaScript and are shared by many other programming languages.

15
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,530
We’ll then develop together, and step by step, an interactive graphic tool that will

16
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,800
use many different features from JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,900
Let’s start having fun with JavaScript, now :-)
